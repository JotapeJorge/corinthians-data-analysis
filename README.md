## Introduction

This project aims to analyze Corinthians results through Python scripts leveraging the Matplotlib library. The analysis is tailored to investigate the period popularly called "A Fila," where Corinthians spent 23 years without winning a Championship, and compare these results with the last six years of the club's performance.

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this directory, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jotapejorge/corinthians-data-analysis.git
   
2.Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd corinthians-data-analysis
    
3.Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1.Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook```

2.Run the cells to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

## File Structure
- **tournaments/**: Directory containing the Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of Corinthians in national and regional tournaments.
- **derby_games/**: Directory containing the Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of Corinthians matches against its main rivals.
- **web_scraping/**: Directory with Python scripts used to gather football data from www.rsssfbrasil.com.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- **README.md**: Documentation file (you are here).


## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

Install the dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt```
    
## Specific Hypothesis
Our analysis is specifically designed to explore the period known as "Fila", where Corinthians spent 23 years without winning a Championship, and compare these results with the club's performance from 2018 to 2023.
## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that the performance of Corinthians in the last six years is notably worse than during the "Fila" period. The team has worse numbers in both point average and historical performance against its main rivals. This suggests a challenging period for the club in recent years, highlighting the need for further examination of contributing factors and potential strategies for improvement.
