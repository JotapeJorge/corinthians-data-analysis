## About

This repository is dedicated to collecting, organizing, and analyzing football data from various sources. It includes Python scripts for web scraping data, creating rankings based on the collected data, and a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization.

## Data

The data in this repository is focused on football statistics and includes various metrics such as player performance, team statistics, match results, and more. The data is stored in the `data/` directory and is available in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for easy access and analysis.

## Web Scraping

The `web_scraping/` directory contains Python scripts used to gather football data from relevant websites. The scripts are designed to fetch data in a structured manner and ensure accurate and up-to-date information.

## Ranking Creation

In the `ranking_creation/` directory, you'll find Python scripts that take the collected football data and generate rankings based on specified criteria. These scripts provide insights into team or player performance and allow for customized ranking methodologies.

## Jupyter Notebook

The `Elo_data.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment for exploring and visualizing the football data. You can use this notebook to gain insights, create visualizations, and perform in-depth analyses.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/JotapeJorge/Brazilian-Football-Data.git`.
2. Explore the `data/` directory to access the football datasets.
3. Review the `web_scraping/` directory for the Python scripts used to gather data from the web.
4. Check out the `ranking_creation/` directory to find scripts for generating rankings.
5. Open and run the `Elo_data.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to interact with and analyze the data.
